We saw in the topic about the types of research that there are transversal, repeated transversal and longitudinal types. What is the best definition for repeated cross-sectional surveys?


Survey carried out on only one occasion with random selection of respondents.

RIGHT
Research carried out on more than one occasion with the same variables being measured, for different samples.


Research is called repeated transversal because it repeats the sample regardless of the number of existing occasions.


Research carried out on, obligatorily, two collection occasions.


Research carried out on more than one occasion with the same variables being measured, for the same samples.

The correct answer is: Research carried out on more than one occasion with the same variables being measured, for different samples.




 

two.
There are several steps in building a survey, some major and some minor. In which part of the process is an analysis of what has been collected to measure, monitor and preserve data quality done?


Assessment of the quality of estimates.


Preparation of the Report.

Wrong
Evaluation of the initial questionnaire.

Wrong
Data Criticism.


Sample selection.


Explanation:
The correct answer is: Data criticism.

Among the characteristics of the sample space, which of the definitions below best fits the theme?


Sample space corresponds only to samples that were selected from the population.


Sample space is the space where the samples that were selected can be obtained.


Sample space is synonymous with probability of sample selection.


It is the set of all possible and similar samples, of the same size n, that can be formed with the N elements of the population.

Right
It is the set of all possible and distinct samples, of the same size n, that can be formed with the N elements of the population.



Explanation:
The correct answer is: It is the set of all possible and distinct samples, of the same size n, that can be formed with the N elements of the population.

A survey aims at the total number of inhabitants in a state that has 80 municipalities. 10 municipalities are selected by AAS, which have, respectively: 100, 300, 200, 400, 500, 200, 350, 200, 400 and 250 thousand inhabitants. What is the estimated total population?


^
and
 = 24,000,000 inhabitants


^
and
 = 26,000,000 inhabitants

Wrong
^
and
 = 21,000,000 inhabitants


^
and
 = 29,000,000 inhabitants

Wrong
^
^
and
 = 23 200,000 inhabitants



Explanation: Calculater the average of 10 cities, and multiple for 80 
This means: 
100*300*200*400*500*200*350*200*400*250/ 10 = 290000/10 *80 = 
The correct answer is:
^
^
and
 = 23 200,000 inhabitants


The sampling process requires the selection of population units. Within the sampling we have the probabilistic and non-probabilistic methods. Regarding the types of sampling defined below, which one presents itself as a type of non-probabilistic sampling?
simple random sampling

Stratified sampling

RIGHT
intentional sampling

Cluster sampling

Comment
Option "C" is correct.


Intentional sampling has an intrinsic bias that seeks to highlight the aspect of interest of the interviewer. Unlike the principles suggested in probability sampling, it is not possible with this type of sampling to make inferences about the population only with the sample constructed in this way.

From a population, it is possible to select a part for study, through some selection method, which we call a sample. According to the definitions below, what is the correct definition of sampling?


Sampling consists of selecting part of a population to observe, so that it is possible to find something about the entire population.

Sampling consists of selecting an entire sample to observe so that it is possible to estimate something about the entire population.

Sampling consists of selecting an entire population to observe, so that it is possible to estimate something about the entire population.

RIGHT
Sampling consists of selecting part of a population to observe, so that it is possible to estimate something about the entire population.

Comment
Option "D" is correct.


The correct definition of sampling is to select part of a population to observe so that it is possible to estimate something about the entire population. The correct term is estimate, because the values ​​found will always be a value that approaches the true. So verbs like get, find or find should never be used.

The use of stratification brings a series of advantages both in sample selection and in the efficiency of estimates. Among the options below, which have only advantages of stratified sampling?


It allows estimation for each research group and increases the sample size.

Right 
It improves the accuracy of estimates and ensures sample selection in each stratum.


Cuts the sample size in half and improves the accuracy of estimates.


It allows a dependent selection in each stratum and decreases the sample size.


It increases the variability of the research variables and guarantees the selection of samples in each stratum.



Explanation:
The correct answer is: Improves the accuracy of estimates and ensures sample selection in each stratum.




 

7.
A population of size 4000 is divided into 40 distinct subpopulations. Through a random selection, 15 subpopulations are selected and all their elements are searched. This type of sampling is called:


Systematic sampling


Deterministic sampling


Stratified sampling


Two-stage cluster sampling

Right
One-stage cluster sampling


Explanation:
The correct answer is: One-stage cluster sampling
